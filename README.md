## Introduction

Traffic congestion is a significant issue in urban areas worldwide, including Saudi Arabia. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to forecast traffic congestion based on historical and real-time data. 

### Key Objectives:
- Predict traffic congestion levels using supervised machine learning models.
- Provide insights to optimize traffic management strategies.
- Reduce travel times and enhance transportation efficiency.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared datasets, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified patterns and correlations in traffic, population, and project data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented and evaluated models, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Gradient Boosting Regression
  - Random Forest Regression
  - XGBoost Regression
- **Model Deployment**: Saved the best-performing model for future use.

## Dataset
The project utilized multiple datasets:
1. **Traffic Index Dataset**: Hourly traffic data for Saudi cities in 2023.
2. **Saudi Projects Dataset**: Details of 2,182 projects, including budgets and timelines.
3. **Population Dataset**: Annual population data from 2011 to 2023.

**Preprocessing Steps**:
- Missing values imputed using median/mode.
- Feature engineering for time-based variables (hour, day_of_week, year).
- Standardized and normalized numerical data.
